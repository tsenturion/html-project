    <h1>Vehicle</h1>

    <p>A vehicle (from Latin: <sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup> vehiculum) is a machine that transports people or cargo. Vehicles include wagons, bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships, boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and spacecraft.<sup><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></sup></p>

    <p>Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground: wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, for road vehicles types, terms and definitions.<sup><a href="#ref3">[3]</a></sup></p>
